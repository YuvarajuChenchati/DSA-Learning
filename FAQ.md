# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) ❓

> **Common questions and answers about the DSA Java Mastery repository**

## 🎯 Getting Started

### Q1: How do I get started with this repository?
**A**: Start with the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) file which provides a structured 6-12 month learning path. Follow the phases:
1. Fundamentals (Complexity, Math, Bit Manipulation)
2. Basic Data Structures (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists)
3. Advanced Data Structures (Trees, Graphs, Heaps)
4. Core Algorithms (Searching, Sorting, Recursion)
5. Advanced Algorithms (DP, Greedy, Backtracking)
6. Pattern Mastery
7. Interview Preparation

### Q2: What's the best way to use this repository?
**A**: 
- **For Students**: Follow the ROADMAP, practice daily, use the study templates, and track your progress
- **For Teachers**: Use the README files for theory, Implementation.java for examples, and Problems.md for assignments

### Q3: Do I need prior Java knowledge?
**A**: Yes, this repository is designed for **advanced Java programmers**. You should be comfortable with:
- Basic Java syntax
- Object-oriented programming
- Collections framework
- Basic data structures

## 📚 Learning Path

### Q4: How long does it take to master DSA?
**A**: 
- **Quick Preparation** (3-6 months): Focus on interview patterns and common problems
- **Comprehensive Mastery** (12+ months): Deep understanding of all topics

This repository is designed for the 12-month comprehensive path but can be adapted for shorter timelines.

### Q5: Should I follow the ROADMAP in order?
**A**: Yes, the ROADMAP is designed to build knowledge progressively:
- Each phase builds on previous phases
- Fundamentals first, then data structures, then algorithms
- Patterns and advanced topics come last

However, you can adjust based on your needs and timeline.

### Q6: How many problems should I solve daily?
**A**: 
- **Beginners**: 2-3 easy problems per day
- **Intermediate**: 3-5 medium problems per day
- **Advanced**: 2-3 hard problems per day

**Quality over quantity**: Focus on understanding rather than just solving.

## 💻 Code and Implementation

### Q7: Do I need to compile and run the code?
**A**: Yes! The Implementation.java files are meant to be run and tested. This helps you:
- Understand how algorithms work
- See actual output
- Experiment with modifications
- Verify correctness

### Q8: Can I modify the code examples?
**A**: Absolutely! Modify, experiment, and extend the code. This is a great way to learn. The code is provided as a learning resource.

### Q9: Why are some implementations not optimized?
**A**: Some implementations prioritize clarity and understanding over optimization. As you progress, you'll learn optimized versions. The README files often explain both approaches.

## 🎯 Problem Solving

### Q10: How do I approach a new problem?
**A**: Use the [Problem-Solving Framework](resources/templates/problem-solving-framework.md):
1. **Understand**: Read and clarify the problem
2. **Plan**: Design solution (brute force → optimized)
3. **Implement**: Code the solution
4. **Test**: Verify with examples
5. **Optimize**: Improve if needed

### Q11: What if I can't solve a problem?
**A**: 
- Don't spend more than 45-60 minutes on one problem
- Read the hints in Problems.md files
- Review the pattern or algorithm in the README
- Look at the Implementation.java for similar examples
- Try a different problem and come back later

### Q12: Should I look at solutions immediately?
**A**: No! Try to solve it yourself first:
1. Try brute force approach
2. Think about optimization
3. Only after 30-45 minutes, peek at hints
4. Study the solution to understand the approach

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Q13: How do I track my progress?
**A**: Use the [Study Schedule Template](resources/templates/study-schedule.md):
- Mark completed topics in main README
- Track problems solved
- Monitor time spent
- Review weak areas regularly

### Q14: How do I know if I'm ready for interviews?
**A**: You're ready when you can:
- Solve easy problems in 15-20 minutes
- Solve medium problems in 30-45 minutes
- Explain your approach clearly
- Handle edge cases automatically
- Recognize patterns quickly

### Q15: What should I focus on for interviews?
**A**: 
- **Common Patterns**: Two pointers, sliding window, DP, etc.
- **Company Questions**: Practice company-specific problems
- **Mock Interviews**: Practice explaining your approach
- **Time Management**: Practice under time pressure

## 🏢 Company Preparation

### Q16: How do I prepare for specific companies?
**A**: 
- Use the [Company-Wise Questions](resources/company-wise/) files
